# sites.africa  website using flask

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...Upgrading my personal website
-  The css is not updating so I can't make the changes I want to. 
-  Might have to use codepen but that's not a great long term solution
# Running flask app




``` python
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ export FLASK_APP=__init__.py
